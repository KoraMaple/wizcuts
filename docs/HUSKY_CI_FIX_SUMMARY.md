# Husky CI/CD Fix - Summary

## Problem

The GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline was failing with:

```
sh: 1: is-ci: not found
sh: 1: husky: not found
npm error code 127
```

## Root Cause

The GitHub Actions workflows were:

1. Only installing dependencies in workspace directories (`frontend/`, `backend/`)
2. Not installing root-level dependencies where `husky` and `is-ci` are defined
3. The `prepare` script runs from the root `package.json` but couldn't find the required binaries

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated GitHub Actions Workflows ✅

**File: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`**

- Added "Install root dependencies" step before workspace dependency installation
- Applied to both `frontend-test` and `backend-test` jobs

**File: `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`**

- Added "Install root dependencies" step before frontend dependency installation

### 2. Enhanced Root Package Configuration ✅

**File: `package.json`**

- Kept the CI-aware prepare script: `"prepare": "is-ci || husky"`
- Maintained `is-ci` dependency for CI environment detection

## How It Works

### Local Development

1. `npm install` runs in any directory
2. `prepare` script executes: `is-ci || husky`
3. `is-ci` returns false (exit code 1)
4. `|| husky` executes, setting up Git hooks

### CI Environment

1. Root dependencies installed first: `npm ci` in root directory
2. `prepare` script executes: `is-ci || husky`
3. `is-ci` detects CI environment, returns true (exit code 0)
4. `|| husky` is skipped (short-circuit evaluation)
5. Workspace dependencies install without Husky interference

## Workflow Changes

### Before

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci # Only workspace deps, prepare script fails
```

### After

```yaml
- name: Install root dependencies
  run: npm ci
  working-directory: ./

- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci # Workspace deps, prepare script succeeds
```

## Testing Results

✅ **Local Development**: `npm run prepare` works correctly ✅ **Simulated CI**:
`CI=true npm run prepare` skips Husky ✅ **Dependencies Available**: Both `is-ci` and `husky`
binaries accessible

## Files Modified

1. `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Added root dependency installation
2. `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` - Added root dependency installation
3. `package.json` - Already had correct prepare script and dependencies

## Benefits

- ✅ CI/CD pipelines no longer fail on Husky
- ✅ Local development Git hooks continue working
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns (CI vs local)
- ✅ Standard industry practice implemented
- ✅ No impact on existing functionality

---

**Status**: Fixed - CI/CD should now pass without Husky errors!
