# Husky CI/CD Fix - FINAL SOLUTION

## Problem Resolved ✅

The GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline was failing with:

```
sh: 1: is-ci: not found
sh: 1: husky: not found
npm error code 127
```

## Final Solution: HUSKY Environment Variable

After trying the `is-ci` approach, we switched to the **official Husky-recommended solution** using
the `HUSKY` environment variable.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Simplified package.json ✅

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky"
  }
}
```

- Removed `is-ci` dependency
- Simplified prepare script back to just `"husky"`

#### 2. Updated GitHub Actions Workflows ✅

**File: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`**

```yaml
- name: Install root dependencies
  run: npm ci
  working-directory: ./
  env:
    HUSKY: 0

- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci
  env:
    HUSKY: 0
```

**File: `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`**

```yaml
- name: Install root dependencies
  run: npm ci
  env:
    HUSKY: 0

- name: Install frontend dependencies
  run: |
    cd frontend
    npm ci
  env:
    HUSKY: 0
```

## How It Works

### Local Development 🖥️

1. `npm install` runs
2. `prepare` script executes: `husky`
3. Husky sets up Git hooks normally

### CI Environment 🤖

1. `HUSKY=0` environment variable is set
2. `npm ci` runs and triggers `prepare` script
3. Husky detects `HUSKY=0` and skips installation with message: "HUSKY=0 skip install"
4. No errors, workflow continues

## Testing Results ✅

**Local Test:**

```bash
$ npm run prepare
> husky
# Git hooks installed successfully
```

**CI Simulation Test:**

```bash
$ HUSKY=0 npm run prepare
> husky
HUSKY=0 skip install
```

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Official Solution**: Recommended by Husky documentation  
✅ **Simple**: No additional dependencies needed  
✅ **Reliable**: Environment variable approach is standard  
✅ **Clean**: Clear separation between local dev and CI  
✅ **Maintainable**: Easy to understand and debug

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `package.json` - Simplified prepare script
2. ✅ `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Added HUSKY=0 to all npm commands
3. ✅ `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` - Added HUSKY=0 to all npm commands

---

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - CI/CD should now pass without Husky errors!
